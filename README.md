# Background
I love solving complex data problems. As a Data Engineer with a knack for problem-solving and a healthy dose of humor, I thrive on turning complex challenges into simple solutions. My journey has taken me from developing automated ETL services to creating integration frameworks that boast 100% accuracy over selected time intervals. I take pride in doing things right the first time; after all, who wants to revisit the same problem twice?

At Two Circles, I had the opportunity to design an integration framework that not only meets our clients' needs but also enhances their overall experience with our services. I developed over 10 new integrations in just under a year; each one tailored to solve specific customer challenges. It’s rewarding to see how these integrations can make a real difference in how businesses operate.

One of my proudest moments was during my time at SSB when I led a project that reduced our reliance on custom code by about 70%. This wasn’t just about numbers; it was about streamlining processes so my team could focus on what really matters.

When I’m not immersed in data architecture or visualization projects, you might find me out on the water rowing or swimming laps. It’s not just a hobby; it teaches me teamwork and discipline—skills that translate seamlessly into my professional life. I believe in finding balance between form and function in everything I do.

If you’re looking for someone who can bring creativity and efficiency to your data projects, or if you just want to share some laughs over coffee, feel free to reach out!
